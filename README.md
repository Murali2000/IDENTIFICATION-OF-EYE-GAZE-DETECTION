IDENTIFICATION OF EYE GAZE DETECTION
The Driver Drowsiness Detector uses a person's eye movements to determine whether or not they are drowsy.

For every specific person, this programme is used to identify drowsiness. With this programme, we measure how long someone has had their eyes closed. The programme will notify the user by playing an alarm sound if the eyes have been closed for a long time, that is, longer than a predetermined threshold value.

Created a strategy to deal with the prevention of drowsiness-related accidents and other related problems.

Key Requirements:
python
Numpy
opencv_python
dlib

The project's primary goal is to identify drowsiness, which can be used for a range of tasks, and to reduce traffic accidents by identifying fatigue.
